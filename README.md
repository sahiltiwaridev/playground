# 🛠️ Playground

My personal testing environment for experimenting with new libraries, features, and coding concepts before implementing them in production projects.

## What is this?

This repository is where I explore unfamiliar territory, test out ideas, and learn through hands-on experimentation. It's a workspace for quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts that don't need to meet production standards.

## ⚠️ Heads Up

This isn't a showcase repository. You'll find:

- Experimental code and incomplete implementations
- Quick tests of libraries and frameworks
- Multiple approaches to the same problem
- Minimal documentation and comments
- Code that prioritizes learning over best practices

**Bottom line:** Don't expect clean code or clear structure here. This repo might look like a mess, and that's intentional.

## Purpose

This is where I:

- Test new libraries before committing to them
- Practice implementing features in a low-stakes environment
- Experiment with different approaches
- Make mistakes safely
- Figure out what works (and what doesn't)

## What This Isn't

- Production-ready code
- A portfolio showcase
- Well-documented or maintained
- Following any particular code style
- Meant to be understood by others

## Philosophy

Learning happens through experimentation. This repo is the messy middle part of that process—where ideas get tested, refined, or abandoned before making it into real projects.

## Contributing

While this is a personal learning space, you're welcome to look around. However, contributing isn't recommended since:

- The code structure changes frequently as I experiment
- There's no consistent direction or roadmap
- Most experiments are abandoned once I've learned what I needed

If you find something useful, feel free to fork it or use it in your own projects.
